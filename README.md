This site requires enabling Hebrew keyboard input. It serves as a Hebrew Bible search engine.

The Home Page has only two search methods to choose from. The user can search for a single word,
or he can choose to search for a phrase, i.e., more than one word, in a verse.

The Home Page also has two parameters the user can set, or change the default values:
The search boundaries, inasmuch as the Bible constitutes 24 books;
And the maximum number of hits, to limit the list size of the Results Page.

Each search method has its own options on the Options Page, where the user also inputs his search string(s).

Once a search method is chosen, two buttons appear, with which the user can either go ahead
to see his Results Page, and from there return to the Options Page to try a new option,
or he can return to Home Page.

This program was developed as a PWA so it be available as an app to download on mobile devices.
